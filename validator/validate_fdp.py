"""FDP-1 reference validator.

Checks a JSON document against the five conformance requirements of
FDP-1 §6 (Food Data Provenance Declaration). It is deliberately small and
dependency-free: the specification is the contract, this file is the proof the
contract is mechanically testable.

Usage:
    python validator/validate_fdp.py examples/iron-two-hosts.json
    python validator/validate_fdp.py < some-declaration.json

Exit status is 0 if every value and score conforms, 1 otherwise.
