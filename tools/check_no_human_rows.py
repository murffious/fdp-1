"""Refuse any data file in this repository that carries a person.

THIS IS A STUDY RULE, NOT FDP-1 CONFORMANCE
-------------------------------------------
FDP-1 §6 asks *is this value properly provenanced*. This asks *does this repository
contain a human being*. Different questions, and this one deliberately lives outside
the specification: adding a policy rule to §6 would change conformance for every third
party implementing FDP-1, which is not ours to do.

WHY IT EXISTS
-------------
Tested 2026-08-29: a food declaration carrying `"human_id": "patient-001"` was handed
to validate_fdp.py and came back **CONFORMS, exit 0**. It sails straight through as an
ignored extra key. Every other failure in this project is recoverable — a wrong id gets
corrected, a bad licence gets renegotiated, a stale score gets re-run. A person's
identifier in a public git history is not. It survives deletion, it survives force-push,
it is in every clone and every fork and the GitHub API.

So this is the one gate that runs before the others.

MENTION vs USE — THE REASON THIS IS NOT A GREP
----------------------------------------------
`STUDY-RULES.md` contains the sentence "no human_id in the food repo". So does this
file, several times. A naive grep flags both and the guard gets switched off inside a
week — the same 27%-false-positive death that nearly killed check_curies.py.

The rule that makes it usable: **a violation is a forbidden name in KEY position in a
structured data file.** Prose that talks about human_id is a mention. A JSON object
with `"human_id":` as a key is a use. Markdown and source code are deliberately out of
scope and that is a design decision, not an oversight — code that *builds* a record is
caught when the record is written, which is the moment that matters.
